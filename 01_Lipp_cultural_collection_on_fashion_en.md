Two collections form the basis for Restaging Fashion: the paintings collection of 19th century collectors Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide and the collection of textiles at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, founded in the 19th century. The corpus of 600 artworks, which Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide accumulated in 30 years with the ambition to document and preserve the history of dress, comprise paintings, miniatures, and a small number of relief images. The images in the Lipperheide collection serve as visual references to past fashion and traditional dress. The earliest work dates back to 1430 and the collection spans four centuries with a focus on the 16th and 17th century. All types of clothing is depicted, from princely attire to local traditional costumes. Lipperheide considered portraits as being the most truthful representations of clothing in images. Hence, more than 500 out of 600 works are portraits, while depictions of genre, historical or biblical scenes are sparse.
