This hairstyle is very often accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls. Later, around 1640, more freedom was given to fringe and side curls; especially in women’s fashion, this harmonised with the soft drape of the dresses. In contrast to the bourgeois women, whose hairstyle required a bonnet, aristocratic ladies were allowed to display their artfully drawn curls openly."),yr.forEach(r),this.h()},h(){d(H,"href","item/159"),d(x,"href","media/45744"),d(C,"href","media/1628"),d(S,"href","media/1602"),d(P,"href","media/3777"),d(I,"href","item/607"),d(L,"href","media/3776"),d(B,"href","media/1560"),d(z,"href","item/9350"),d(G,"href","item/159"),d(q,"href","item/9390"),d(Y,"href","item/10613"),d(J,"href","item/10536"),d(j,"href","item/10946"),d(D,"href","item/10586"),d(O,"href","item/10913"),d(R,"href","item/607"),d(N,"href","item/10550"),d(U,"href","item/43003"),d(K,"href","item/10426"),d(X,"href","item/10427"),d(Q,"href","item/10421"),d(Z,"href","set/48310"),d($,"href","set/48311"),d(ee,"href","item/9425"),d(te,"href","set/45248"),d(ae,"href","item/10290"),d(re,"href","item/353"),d(oe,"href","item/25436"),d(ie,"href","set/48313")},m(o,f){c(o,A,f),e(A,We),c(o,ke,f),c(o,b,f),e(b,Ge),e(b,H),e(H,qe),e(b,Ye),e(b,x),e(x,Je),e(b,je),e(b,C),e(C,De),e(b,Oe),c(o,Fe,f),c(o,M,f),e(M,Re),c(o,He,f),c(o,u,f),e(u,Ne),e(u,S),e(S,Ue),e(u,Ve),e(u,le),e(le,Ke),e(u,Xe),e(u,P),e(P,Qe),e(u,Ze),e(u,de),e(de,I),e(I,$e),e(u,et),e(u,fe),e(fe,tt),e(u,at),e(u,L),e(L,rt),e(u,ot),e(u,B),e(B,it),e(u,nt),e(u,z),e(z,st),e(u,ht),c(o,xe,f),c(o,W,f),e(W,lt),c(o,Ce,f),c(o,h,f),e(h,dt),e(h,G),e(G,ft),e(h,ct),e(h,q),e(q,ut),e(h,mt),e(h,ce),e(ce,Y),e(Y,pt),e(h,gt),e(h,ue),e(ue,J),e(J,bt),e(h,wt),e(h,j),e(j,yt),e(h,vt),e(h,me),e(me,D),e(D,Tt),e(h,Et),e(h,pe),e(pe,O),e(O,_t),e(h,At),e(h,R),e(R,kt),e(h,Ft),e(h,ge),e(ge,N),e(N,Ht),e(h,xt),e(h,U),e(U,Ct),e(h,Mt),e(h,be),e(be,St),e(h,Pt),e(h,we),e(we,It),e(h,Lt),e(h,ye),e(ye,Bt),e(h,zt),e(h,ve),e(ve,Wt),e(h,Gt),e(h,Te),e(Te,qt),e(h,Yt),c(o,Me,f),c(o,V,f),e(V,Jt),c(o,Se,f),c(o,p,f),e(p,jt),e(p,K),e(K,Dt),e(p,Ot),e(p,Ee),e(Ee,Rt),e(p,Nt),e(p,X),e(X,Ut),e(p,Vt),e(p,_e),e(_e,Kt),e(p,Xt),e(p,Q),e(Q,Qt),e(p,Zt),c(o,Pe,f),c(o,w,f),e(w,$t),e(w,Z),e(Z,ea),e(w,ta),e(w,$),e($,aa),e(w,ra),e(w,ee),e(ee,oa),e(w,ia),c(o,Ie,f),c(o,E,f),e(E,na),e(E,te),e(te,sa),e(E,ha),e(E,ae),e(ae,la),e(E,da),c(o,Le,f),c(o,g,f),e(g,fa),e(g,Ae),e(Ae,ca),e(g,ua),e(g,re),e(re,ma),e(g,pa),e(g,oe),e(oe,ga),e(g,ba),e(g,ie),e(ie,wa),e(g,ya),c(o,Be,f),c(o,ne,f),e(ne,va),c(o,ze,f),c(o,se,f),e(se,Ta)},p:Ea,i:Ea,o:Ea,d(o){o&&r(A),o&&r(ke),o&&r(b),o&&r(Fe),o&&r(M),o&&r(He),o&&r(u),o&&r(xe),o&&r(W),o&&r(Ce),o&&r(h),o&&r(Me),o&&r(V),o&&r(Se),o&&r(p),o&&r(Pe),o&&r(w),o&&r(Ie),o&&r(E),o&&r(Le),o&&r(g),o&&r(Be),o&&r(ne),o&&r(ze),o&&r(se)}}}const Fr={title:"A family portrait",isPublic:!0,lang:"en",color:"red",author:"Sabine de Günther",description:"The oil painting can be described and interpreted in multiple ways: At first glance, it shows three elegant young ladies and two gentlemen in a landscape. Each of the figures depicted is assigned an object, e.g. a bird or a mirror. These attributes refer to the five human senses - taste, smell, sight, hearing and touch - one of the most varied and appealing motifs in European painting. At the same time, the work is also a family portrait of five siblings of a family from the north-east of Baden-Württemberg, the former principality of the House of Hohenlohe. In addition, it depicts fashion from the time of the Thirty Years' War in Germany.",cover:"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/files/large/3462bf943aaa761056dba91c89a90652c4833aaf.jpg"};class Hr extends Tr{constructor(A){super(),Er(this,A,null,Ar,_r,{})}}export{Hr as default,Fr as metadata};
