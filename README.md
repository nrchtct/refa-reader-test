# ReFa Reader
![Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 15 50 12](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/refa-essays/assets/20107875/1f044cf6-d8de-46e2-a26e-6fab4613c908)

An interactive visualisation that provides access to a selection of objects from the 'Lipperheidesche Kost√ºmbibliothek'. Different texts are juxtaposed with a graph navigation that allows the user to browse the paintings, prints, drawings and clothes in the collection. Instead of showing the collection in its entirety, it is accessible through a curated selection of essays designed to provide a better understanding of it, combining editorial approaches with free exploration and user-driven granularity.
